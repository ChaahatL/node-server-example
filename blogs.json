    "content": "Cellular metabolism is essential for adult neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) behavior. These cells can be reactivated to form new neurons. However, its role in the transition from quiescence to proliferation has yet to be fully understood. A team led by scientists from the Universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Lausanne (UNIL) has discovered the importance of cell metabolism in this process and identified how to wake up these neural stem cells and reactivate them. They successfully increased the number of new neurons in the brain of adult and even elderly mice. The brain is constructed during embryonic development by neural stem cells (NSCs), which produce all other central nervous system cells, including neurons. Interestingly, NSCs keep growing and can produce new neurons in specific brain regions even after the brain has fully developed. Adult neurogenesis is a biological process crucial for particular tasks, including memory and learning."

    "content": "Robotic locomotion in subterranean environments is still unsolved. It requires innovative designs and strategies to overcome the challenges of burrowing and moving in unstructured conditions with high pressure and friction at depths of a few centimeters. Now, a team of researchers at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT-Italian Institute of Technology) in Genoa has realized a new soft robot inspired by the biology of earthworms. The robot can crawl thanks to soft actuators that elongate or squeeze when air passes through them or is drawn out. The bio-inspired robot could be used for underground exploration, search and rescue operations in confined spaces, and the exploration of other planets. Nature offers many examples of animals, such as snakes, earthworms, snails, and caterpillars, which use both the flexibility of their bodies and the ability to generate physical traveling waves along the length of their body to move and explore different environments. Natural burrowers such as earthworms are entirely soft and possess a hydrostatic skeleton. They use alternating contractions of muscle layers to propel themselves both below and above the soil surface by generating retrograde peristaltic waves. The individual segments of their body (metameres) have a specific quantity of fluid that controls the internal pressure to exert forces and perform independent, localized, and variable movement patterns."

    "content": "India vs Australia Champions Trophy 2025 Live Streaming Details: India and Australia are once again set to face each other in the knockouts of an ICC tournament. The two powerhouses will clash in the first semi-final of the 2025 Champions Trophy. The highly anticipated ODI fixture will be hosted at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on March 4. India have been on a three-match winning streak. Placed in Group A, the Men in Blue convincingly beat Bangladesh, Pakistan, and New Zealand to finish at the top of the standings.\n\nAustralia, on the other hand, overcame Ashes rivals England in the tournament opener. The next two matches against South Africa and Afghanistan were abandoned due to bad weather in Pakistan. Australia received one point from each washed-out fixture and qualified for the semi-final as the second-placed team from Group B.",

    "content": "Vivo has recently launched its new Vivo V27 Pro and Vivo V27 smartphones in India. The Vivo V27 Pro is the more premium of the two and also comes with better features and specifications. The handset is priced starting at Rs 37,999 for the base 8GB + 128GB variant and we have been using the phone for a while now. Here are our initial impressions of the phone. Colour-changing back is an add-on and gives it a unique look and feel Vivo V27 Pro comes with a colour-changing back. The Blue colour on our unit turned a little darker when exposed to sunlight. MediaTek Dimensity 8200 performs well The handset is powered by MediaTek Dimensity 8200 chipset paired with up to 12GB RAM. In the brief time, we used the phone, it offered smooth overall performance and we did not notice any delay or lag while navigating, opening or closing the app and even during multitasking.",
